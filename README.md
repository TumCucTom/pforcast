# PForcast - Lifetime Financial Budget Planner

## Overview
PForcast is a personal-finance **forecasting and planning tool**.  Add all your incomes, expenses, and assets once and the app will run 30-year, month-by-month projections so you can answer questions like:

* "When will I become cash-flow negative?"
* "What if inflation jumps to 6 %?"
* "How large will my ISA portfolio be by age 60?"

The UI is 100 % client-side React (Next 14/15), the data lives in Postgres via Prisma, and an optional Groq-powered assistant guides financial decisions in plain English.

## VibeOps Workflow
This repo is wired to **VibeOps** for both issue tracking _and_ hands-free deployments:

1. Open a GitHub Issue with the `vibeops` label â†’ a staging preview spins up automatically.
2. Merge to `main` â†’ VibeOps triggers the Vercel production build.
3. Health-checks & comments are posted back to the PR so you never deploy a broken commit.
